# Flashcard-Generator
This application is a node.js based study aide.  The user can create their own flashcard or play with prepared flashcards.

Both Cloze cards and Basic cards are available.

This application is build entirely with node.js.  Additionally, I used inquirer npm package to prompt the user and move through application.


##Create Card

If the user chooses to create their own cards, they then can choose to make Cloze cards or Basic cards.
